                    I am 23 years old and from Florida. I graduated May of 2020 and started teaching English
                    at a middle school near me. I started learning about data because my degree was in Economics
                    (and middle schoolers are difficult to deal with 5 days a week) and that's how I began my 
                    new career as a Software Engineer! My husband and I are currently in Canada for another few 
                    weeks and my Florida bones are praying for snow. We like to go new places and play excessive 
                    amounts of card games.
