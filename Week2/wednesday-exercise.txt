int score = 80; // A variable of type int and of name score is declared and is assigned a value of 80;

String result; // This is assigning "result" to be a string so it can be an array of characters.

// if/else statements determine if a code will run based on the condition provided

if (score == 80) {
	result = "You passed!"; // This returns a boolean result. It checks to make sure "score" equals 80 and 80 equals "score" as stored in the heap. 
} else if (score > 80) {
	result = "You did great!";// This says if the int of score is more than 80, it will return a different result because you performed above and beyond.
} else {
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!";// This covers every int of score below 80 and lets the user know they did not pass. 
}

System.out.println(result); // for every "result =" listed, it will print out the phrase assigned according to their statement.
